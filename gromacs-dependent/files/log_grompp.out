NOTE 1 [file TMP.mdp, line unknown]:
  You are using a cut-off for VdW interactions with NVE, for good energy
  conservation use vdwtype = Shift (possibly with DispCorr)


NOTE 2 [file TMP.mdp, line unknown]:
  You are using a cut-off for electrostatics with NVE, for good energy
  conservation use coulombtype = PME-Switch or Reaction-Field-zero
